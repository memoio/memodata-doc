# Core Components

## mDID-Decentralized Identity for Accounts

* Generates a unique **on-chain account DID** without reliance on centralized registration or verification.

* Users fully control identity data, supporting **privacy protection** (e.g., selective disclosure) and **cross-platform authentication**.

## mfileDID - Decentralized Identity for Files 

* **Data Ownership & Traceability**: Assigns a unique mfileDID to files/data, enabling on-chain ownership records and transaction tracking.

* **Data Monetization**: Users can store, authorize access, or trade data assets, creating an economic model for personal data rights.

* **Data Functions**: Enables **read, write, purchase, and sharing** of data, fully controlled by the owner (account DID).
